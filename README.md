2013.Practice.WebDesign
=======================
This is a set of files used as part of practice work for the Team Treehouse online training course on Web Design. 

The files are created in Sublime Text 2, not in Git.  

My current plan is that each file will be deleted and replaced by new files from my Sublime Text directory each time I share the current status of my work.
