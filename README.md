2013.Practice.WebDesign
=======================
This is a set of files used as part of practice work for the Team Treehouse online training course on Web Design. 

The files are created in Sublime Text 2, not in Git.  

My current plan is that the entire repository will be deleted and replaced each time I share the current status of my work.
